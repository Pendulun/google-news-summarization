# Google News Summarization (WIP)

This is my final project for the NLP class at UFMG. It consists in a news headlines summarizer.

It uses the [GoogleNews API](https://github.com/Iceloof/GoogleNews) and the HuggingFace summarization pipeline to summarize only the headlines of a given search. I summarize only the headlines as I'm trying to just give a quick overview of the search news and this makes it unnecessary to scrape the news text for every source. 

It is still a work in progress, and this README should be updated with time.
